								<h1>Worker Empowerment (WE) Caucus<br /></h1>
								<h2>Our Platform</h2>
								<br />
								<p> <strong>The Worker Empowerment (WE) Caucus</strong> is committed to a unionism that builds power from the bottom up, creating lasting change within our institution. WE will improve the public perception of higher education and of our labor within it. To that end, WE will build a highly participatory union where all members work together to improve our material conditions through bargaining for raises, job and salary equity, academic freedom, and the right to teach, learn, research, and serve as we – not management – deem appropriate. Our caucus is committed to the principle that our working conditions are our students’ learning conditions and the belief that the status quo of liberal politics has fallen woefully short of addressing the urgent needs of workers. WE will listen, organize, and take meaningful action to empower workers’ voices and improve workers’ lives in this time of growing authoritarianism that is set on dismantling public goods, the federal government and higher education, among other sectors. Our caucus is further committed to the belief that our status as workers unites us in solidarity with all laborers struggling for justice and equity around the globe. WE will approach our union organizing as part of the fight for social justice, the restitution of civil and human rights, the redress of historical inequities and the envisioning of a better society for all. And we believe that WE will win!</p>

              <h2> Statements </h2>
                      <p><a id="annika"></a><strong>Annika Barber - Tenure Track Faculty Vice President </strong>: "I am running for the first time as a candidate for the position of vice president for tenure track faculty. I am a 5th year assistant professor in Waksman Institute and Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry. I have been involved with the union for several years, including attending the STEM PI working groups and speaking against cuts to the writing program. I also represented the union in DC this spring speaking against cuts to National Institutes of Health funding, and organized the New Jersey Stand Up for Science rally in Trenton with nearly 500 attendees from institutions across the state. In an era of unprecedented attacks against higher education and scientific research, I am passionate about bringing more science colleagues into union efforts to defend our work and our funding.
                      <br>
                      <br> 
                      The Rutgers Union serves as a national model for how workers can unite to improve higher education for workers and for students, something we need now more than ever. I believe in transparent shared governance and change driven by union members. I will create avenues to hear from tenure track faculty across all disciplines to ensure I represent you. As a junior faculty member who started just before the pandemic, I will work to ensure that promotion and tenure considerations are fair for faculty who have made it through multiple “unprecedented times” in their academic journey. I supervise and work closely with postdoctoral fellows and graduate workers in my research lab and will be able to work productively with their representatives to coordinate our shared interests and efforts. 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      I would be honored to serve as your vice president for tenure track faculty."</p>
              
                      <p><a id="shelby"></a><strong>Shelby Wardlaw - Non-Tenure Track Faculty Vice President </strong>: "It has been a pleasure serving you as VP for NTTs since 2023. In the past two years I have served on the Executive Council, the Legislative Committee, the By-laws Committee, the NTT Working Group and the Mary Gibson Internship Committee. I started and chaired the NTT Working Group in 2023, intending to create a space for NTT issues and advocacy. The group has now transitioned into the NTT Contract Taskforce, and is working on a wish-list of contract amendments for our next bargaining campaign. In the fall of 2024, I restarted the <a href="https://rutgersaaup.org/mary-gibson-internship-for-undergraduate-activists/">Mary Gibson Internship for Undergraduate Activists</a>. The internship is now funding five wonderful undergraduates as they work on projects to improve our community. 
    <br>
    <br>
    In addition, I have held three office hours a semester to hear from NTTs directly. I’ve kept folks updated with monthly newsletters. I have hosted NTT promotional information sessions, answered contract questions, attended protests, canvassed for local union-friendly politicians and coordinated with other union leaders to push back on the detrimental cuts to our Writing Program.
    <br>
    <br>
    There is a lot to be done – now more than ever – and I would be honored to continue this important work. I believe in transparent governance and a member-driven union. During my second term, I would continue to live out these values in leadership."
                    </p>
                     <p><a id="andrew"></a><strong>Andrew Gosselin - Graduate Worker Vice President </strong>:
                     "Since our monumental strike in Spring 2023, I have been engaged in rank and file member organizing, advocated in support and in the defense of graduate worker’s needs to the university administration and union leadership, and have coordinated with unions across the university to improve the livelihood of all Rutgers workers. Our next contract campaign is coming in Fall 2026, and building a united union membership, and having strong graduate representation on the executive council is critical to ensure successful negotiations. I aim to graduate from my PhD program in December 2025, and would serve as the Vice President of Graduate Workers for a short time. However, in this time, I will work with new GSC members, aiding in the transfer of information from the previous GSC, providing information on how union infrastructure works, how to facilitate change at the executive council, and push for graduate worker needs during negotiations. I will work to ensure our union is prepared to work in the interest of graduate workers and the most precariously positioned among us. I believe that ensuring this gets done is the best way to improve the lives of graduate workers at Rutgers and ask for your vote."

                     <p><a id="alanna"></a><strong> Alanna Beroiza - New Brunswick Faculty Executive Council Representative</strong>:
                     "I am eager to serve as a faculty representative to the Executive Council. I am an Assistant Teaching Professor in the Writing Program and I have been a union member since I began working at Rutgers in the fall of 2019. I participated in member outreach and marched on the picket lines during our 2023 strike. In February of this year, I helped to organize a cohort of union members to participate in a three-week AAUP Skills to Win training where members learned how to map their workplaces and have effective organizing conversations with co-workers. Following the training, I spent six weeks canvassing the New Brunswick campuses and I had the opportunity to speak with members from various disciplines about the ongoing issues that our community is facing from cuts to research funding, to issues with international visas, assaults on diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, inadequate housing situations, increased course caps and minimums, non-reappointment of contingent faculty, and much more. I believe in the power of member to member organizing, high participation member driven actions, and organizing within our larger communities. As a member of the Executive Council, I will do my best to support a union that is powered by the collective will and actions of its members. "
                     </p>
                     
                     
                    <p><a id="britt"></a><strong> Britt Paris - New Brunswick Faculty Executive Council Representative</strong>:
                    Britt Paris is newly-tenured Associate Professor in Library & Information Science at SC&I (as of July 1, 2025) on the Rutgers-New Brunswick campus. She joined the faculty in the Fall of 2019 and has been an AAUP-AFT department rep at Rutgers since Spring 2020. In Summer 2020, she co-authored a report for the union about privacy, labor, and intellectual property concerns with Rutgers’ contracts with corporate educational technology vendors. She is continuing this work as she chairs AAUP national ad hoc committee on AI in the Profession producing research and developing strategy for worker-centered governance around technology in higher education. 
<br>
<br>
Since beginning her first EC term, starting in 2023, she has co-chaired the union's joint Media and Communications committee, with the lecturer unit, coming up with and executing plans for communications strategy around union activities. This committee work has led to collaboration and participation in other committee work, including ad hoc committee work that developed the union’s community guidelines. She also worked with members to begin the Disability Justice Working Group. She is excited to continue her work on the EC to organize around various union initiatives to enact member-driven structural changes at Rutgers.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p><a id="nikaytaa"></a><strong> Nikaytaa Malhotra - New Brunswick Graduate Worker Executive Council Representative </strong>:
                    "I am a graduate worker and co-chair of the International Workers Solidarity Committee (IWSC). Over the past six months, I have worked with international workers and domestic allies to ensure international workers on campus feel safe and heard. Over the past six months, we have hosted fortnightly listening sessions, worked on <a href="https://rutgersaaup.org/sanctuary-campus-and-protections-for-international-workers-demands-for-the-rutgers-administration/">demands for the Rutgers administration</a> for Sanctuary Campus and Protections for International Workers, and set up resources for international students.
<br>
<br>
All graduate students face dual challenges: budget cuts from the university administration and pressures from the federal government. International graduate workers are experiencing an extra set of challenges that includes but is not limited to maintaining status and navigating the precarity of travel and research. 
<br>
<br>
As we approach the 2026 contract negotiations, we need a comprehensive plan to address these challenges. Our goal must be to secure a contract that guarantees living wages, affordable and safe housing for all undergraduate, graduate and postdoc workers, and legal and financial protections for international students across all three campuses.
<br>
<br>
I look forward to working with graduate workers and faculty to build collective power and prefigure the Rutgers community and university we envision.
"                   </p>
                    <p><a id="mehedi"></a><strong> Mehedi Zaman - New Brunswick Graduate Worker Executive Council Representative </strong>:
                    "I, Mehedi, as a relatively new union member am putting myself forward for one of the leadership positions, through which I aim to advocate for all grad workers’ issues, especially focusing on incoming/new grad workers, who find it challenging to start afresh at Rutgers, and do not have enough resources compared to others. As an upcoming 2nd year doctoral student, I have also faced many of the challenges new grad workers encounter very recently, and I want to help address those issues for the overall betterment of all grad workers. I plan to work with our new leadership to ensure we continue to work for the best interest of our grad workers at Rutgers. Nothing about us, without us, is for us!"
                    </p>
		    <p><a id="eric"></a> <strong> Eric Putney - New Brunswick Graduate Worker Executive COuncil Representative </strong>:
		    "The Graduate Steering Committee (GSC) fights for grad workers and represents our priorities at our union's executive council (EC). As a member of the Worker Empowerment (WE) caucus, I believe that the rank-and-file based organizing structure that our GSC has developed and facilitated over the last several years has fundamentally changed what we as a union are able to talk about and fight for.
		   <br> <br>
By bringing this member-led organizing structure into the 2026 contract campaign, WE will win union representation and equal pay and benefits for graduate fellows, improve protections for our international colleagues and vulnerable workers, and hold Rutgers to its promises to protect free speech and academic freedom. Don't just vote for me. Get involved in committees and help your union and the GSC build worker power together."
		    </p>
		    <p><a id="alex"></a><strong> Alex (Jiahong) Lu - New Brunswick Leadership Committee Representative </strong>:
		    "My name is Alex Lu, and I’m a first-year Assistant Professor of Library and Information Science at SC&I on the New Brunswick campus. My academic work is rooted in centering impacted communities’ voices and expertise in technology and policy design. Before coming to Rutgers, I was a social worker with experiences of organizing with community groups and grassroots coalitions in Detroit to push back against surveillance technologies and advocate for public housing justice. There, I’ve worked closely with residents and communities, engaging in political education to raise awareness about technology harms, facilitating community dialogues on surveillance, mobilizing public housing residents to advocate for their rights, and building pathways for mutual aid and support. As part of the New Brunswick chapter leadership committee, I am committed to building bridges across faculty, students, and staff to strengthen our networks of care and collective power to hold the administration accountable. As an international faculty member, I am especially dedicated to creating safe spaces for precarious international members to share their voices and needs and actively participate in union actions. Thank you!"
		    </p>
                    <p><a id="brend"></a><strong> Brendan Mahoney - New Brunswick Leadership Committee Representative </strong>:
                    "Hello! I’m brend (he/they), an Assistant Teaching Professor in Library & Information Science at SC&I on the Rutgers-New Brunswick campus. I was thrilled to join Rutgers this past Fall because it serves not only as an example for public universities around the country but also as an example of what an engaged, wall-to-wall union can accomplish in higher education. It is this example that I will strive to uphold as Representative. In my time so far at Rutgers, I’ve participated as a department co-rep in LIS as well as an organizer in the recent campaign to have roughly 160 physicians at the RWJ teaching hospital added to our Council of AAUP chapters. Before coming to Rutgers, I organized for three years with hundreds of other graduates at the University of Pennsylvania to win recognition for a grad worker union. I’ve lived in Philadelphia for the better part of a decade now and have worked with organizations fighting to win housing justice, protesting police brutality, and distributing mutual aid. Along the way, I’ve nurtured a passion for organizing with the people around me to win us all the dignity and security that we’re owed. I look forward to continuing the fight for dignity and security at Rutgers."

                    <p><a id="zainab"></a><strong> Zainab Tanvir - New Brunswick Leadership Committee Representative </strong>:
                    "I served as a union representative while a graduate student at Rutgers–Newark, and I carry those same values into my role as a faculty member. As part of the New Brunswick chapter leadership, my goal is to strengthen our local network and sense of community by organizing around shared goals and values. I believe in building a workplace culture rooted in equity, solidarity, and mutual support. One where every member is equally represented. I would be a good fit for this position because I bring both experience and a deep commitment to collective action. I’ve worked across campuses and understand the different challenges faculty face. I’m an effective communicator, a strong believer in inclusive leadership, and I’m not afraid to speak up or do the work. I also run my own nonprofit, where I lead community-based initiatives, an experience that has sharpened my ability to organize, collaborate, and advocate. "
